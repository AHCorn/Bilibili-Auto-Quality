## ❤ Acknowledgements
Before developing this script, I had been using [Bilibili 视频默认选择最高清晰度](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/374770-bilibili-%E8%A7%86%E9%A2%91%E9%BB%98%E8%AE%A4%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E6%B8%85%E6%99%B0%E5%BA%A6), but since it was no longer available, I rewrote this script. Compared to that script, this one adds a user settings panel and automatic settings for lossless audio.

The code from lines 26 - 30 of this script is from [Bilibili 解锁杜比全景声 & 8K &开启 HDR &直播画质PRO](https://greasyfork.org/zh-TW/scripts/441403).

If there are any issues, feedback is always welcome. Thank you very much.
